# Helper to search the iTunes API
# 
# For now this just returns the parsed JSON as a hash, it's conceivable that 
# this could transform them into nicer objects if needed
# 
# For this exercise we're just concerned with looking up individual albums, 
# so that's all that's implemented
# 
# See the docs for details on the full API
